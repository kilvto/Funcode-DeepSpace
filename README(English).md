## 🚀 Project Overview

`Funcode-DeepSpace` is a learning and creative game project that includes animated sequences, interaction mechanisms, and level design. It serves as a practical example for C programming and the FunCode platform.

---

## 🧩 Core Gameplay

- 🕹️ **Platform Jumping**: The character can jump, move, and activate platform mechanisms to overcome terrain challenges.
- 🧠 **Puzzle Elements**: Levels contain interactive devices like mechanisms, circuits, and lasers that require logical connections and operation.
- 🎬 **Story Cutscenes**: Multiple intro/outro scenes create an immersive space adventure atmosphere.
- 🎵 **Audio Feedback**: Background music and sound effects enhance player immersion.
